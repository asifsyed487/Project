class InheritArrayObject extends ArrayObject {

    public function __set($name, $val) {
        $this[$name] = $val;
    }

    public function displayAsTable() {
        $table =  '<table>';
        $table .= '<tbody>';    
        $all_data = (array) $this;
        foreach ($all_data as $key => $value) {
            $table .= '<tr>';
            $table .= '<td>' . $key . '</td>';
            $table .= '<th>' . $value . '</th>';
            $table .= '</tr>';
        }    
        $table .= '</tbody>';
        $table .=  '</table>';    
        return $table;
    } 
}

$object = new InheritArrayObject();    
$object->Name = 'Syed Md. Asif Hossain'; 
$object->Gender = 'Male'; 
$object->Profession = 'Software Engineer'; 
$object->Institute = 'East West University';


Explanation: ArrayObject was said to use in the question. Through ArrayObject, we can work with objects as arrays. So i declared a class which
took all the functionalities from ArrayObject through inheritence. then inside this class i created function where i created the table manually.



3.
select u.user_id, 
u.first_name, 
u.last_name, 
tr.test_id, 
avg(tr.correct), 
cast(time_taken as date) as date, 
cast(time_taken as time) as time
from user u
left join test_result tr
on u.user_id=tr.user_id
group by u.user_id;

Explanation: Here i have used left join as it was said in question paper that all user entries should appear. 
So i put the user table first, then the test_result at second.
